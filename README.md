# Forza Horizon 5 Skill Point and Wheelspin Macro

## Introduction
This project provides a macro to automate the process of earning skill points and wheelspins in Forza Horizon 5.

## Features
- Automates skill point farming (in EventLab)
- Automates forzathon point farming (BMW M5 1995 or Lexus SC300 or Jaguar E-type Perk)
- ~~Automates wheelspin farming (Peel Trident Perk)~~
  - The Peel Trident's skill point tree was nerfed one week after I started using this script. :(
- Automates gift dropping

## How to use
### Skill Point
1. Enter your Farming EventLab. (145 828 346 or Search the GamerTag "KarmaDriving")
2. In the "Start Race Event Button" showing menu, Start the macro script.
3. The macro will automatically start farming.
### Forzathon Point
1. In the "Garage" menu, Start the macro script.
2. The macro will automatically repeat buying the car and unlocking perks.
### Wheelspin
1. In the "Garage" menu, Start the macro script.
2. The macro will automatically repeat buying a Peel Trident and unlocking perks.
### GiftDrop
1. In the "GiftDrop" menu, Start the macro script.
2. The macro will automatically send all Peel cars.
> **Warning:** Since it sends all Peel cars, it will also send the Peel P50.  
> **Note:** If you send the Peel Trident, the recipient can also do the Wheelspin farming since the perks will be restored. Well, that's just the spirit of Horizon, isn't it?
